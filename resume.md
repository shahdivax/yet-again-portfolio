Experience
Jr. AI/ML Developer March 2025 : Present
Avinyaa Edtech Private Limited
• Developing and refining an advanced grammar checker for KreativeSpace’s AI Writing Tools Suite by fine-tuning LLMs
for high accuracy and natural language output.
• Designing and training a multilingual AI text classification system to detect AI-generated content in English, Hindi,
Spanish, German, Dutch, and Italian, achieving up to 95% accuracy often outperforming Quillbot’s AI detector and
approaching GPTZero’s performance.
Jr. Python Developer May 2024 : March 2025
Thinkbiz Technology Private Limited
• Build a scalable proof of concept of an advanced chat-bot system using LangChain Agents and LLM, capable of
processing both structured (SQL) and unstructured data sources, featuring around 17 Agents with intercommunication,
role-based access control, real-time document ingestion, and automated source citation for enhanced transparency and
security.
• Developed an advanced OCR-LLM pipeline for Jugaad that upgraded document processing: improved invoice extraction
accuracy from 15% to 85%, and receipt processing accuracy from 10% to 90% across multiple formats.
AI and Synthetic Data Developer Intern January 2024 : April 2024
DMI Finance Private Limited
• Developed a generative AI system for generating synthetic structured data, creating a proper pipeline for data cleaning,
de-duplication, and embedding, using Python, Gradio, and PyTorch for model fine-tuning.
• Designed an end to end Gradio Application for easy user interaction, simplifying the synthetic data generation process
and enhancing system usability.
Projects
Sanskrit-Qwen-7B-Translate-v2 September 2025 – September 2025
• Fine-tuned Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct specifically for Sanskrit language processing, provides Sanskrit to IAST
Transliteration, Sanskrit to English Translation and Vice versa. This model was trained using LoRA (Low-Rank
Adaptation) on a comprehensive Sanskrit dataset, released on the Hugging Face Hub with detailed model cards, and a
demo.
Sanskrit-Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-OCR August 2025 – September 2025
• Fine-tuned a version of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, specifically adapted for Sanskrit OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
tasks. The model was trained using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on a dataset of Sanskrit text images and their
corresponding transcriptions.
• The model achieved a 100% success rate with 314 samples, with 86.38% character-level accuracy, and 50.44% token-level
Jaccard similarity and 1.59% exact match accuracy. Released on Hugging Face Hub with detailed model cards, visualized
metrics, and an interactive demo.
